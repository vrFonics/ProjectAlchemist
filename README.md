# ProjectAlchemist
This GitHub repository contains the source code for the work-in-progress third-person action rpg game 'Project Alchemist' being developed in Unreal Engine 5.1 as a Senior Capstone project with a team of 7 other students at Full Sail University.

All C++ code was developed by me, Caleb Samek.
